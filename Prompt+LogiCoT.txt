Function Ranking in Priority Groups
Software vulnerabilities are frequently identified in software that is already in production. Consequently, software development teams must make changes in the source code to fix those vulnerabilities, which are usually present in code units that are lengthy and complex.
Therefore, we need more than just vulnerability detection to identify the most (potentially) problematic code units in the early phases of development so that the software development team can analyze them.
To help develop such a technique, we kindly ask you to categorize a C function into priority groups based on its security risks, complexity, and maintainability, using logical reasoning rules. The priority groups (from a security perspective) are as follows:
    • Critical: The source code is hard to understand and likely to be faulty or vulnerable.
    • High: The source code has some complexity, but it can be understood after reading it a couple of times.
    • Medium: The source code can be understood well, but it would benefit from some refactoring.
    • Low: The source code is easy to understand.
    • Lowest: The source code does not need any maintenance change.

Step 1: Define Logical Rules for Evaluation
Each function is evaluated based on three factors:
    1. Security Risk (SR)
        ◦ SR = 3 → High-risk vulnerability present (e.g., buffer overflow, memory leaks, unsafe pointer usage).
        ◦ SR = 2 → Moderate risk (e.g., unchecked user input, possible race conditions).
        ◦ SR = 1 → Low or no security risk (e.g., read-only operations).
    2. Code Complexity (CC)
        ◦ CC = 3 → Deep nesting, recursion, or unclear logic.
        ◦ CC = 2 → Moderate complexity, but still readable.
        ◦ CC = 1 → Simple and easy to understand.
    3. Maintainability (M)
        ◦ M = 3 → Requires significant refactoring (e.g., poor variable naming, redundant logic).
        ◦ M = 2 → Moderate maintainability concerns.
        ◦ M = 1 → Clean, well-structured, and requires no refactoring.

Final_Score Calculation:
Final_Score = (SR*0.5) + (CC*0.3) + (M*0.2)
where weights prioritize security risks (50%), followed by complexity (30%), and maintainability (20%).

Step 2: Example Evaluations Using LogiCoT
Example 1:
void processData(char *input) {
    char buffer[50];
    strcpy(buffer, input);  // Potential buffer overflow
    printf("Processed: %s\n", buffer);
}
Step-by-Step Logical Analysis:
    • Security Risk (SR): strcpy allows buffer overflow → SR = 3.
    • Code Complexity (CC): Simple logic, no deep nesting → CC = 1.
    • Maintainability (M): Unsafe, requires refactoring → M = 3.
Final_Score = (3*0.5) + (1*0.3) + (3*0.2) = 1.5 + 0.3 + 0.6 = 2.4
Conclusion: Critical (Threshold: Score ≥ 2.0).

Example 2:
int compute(int a, int b) {
    if (a > 10) {
        if (b > 20) {
            return a * b;
        } else {
            return a + b;
        }
    } else {
        return a - b;
    }
}
Step-by-Step Logical Analysis:
    • Security Risk (SR): No unsafe operations → SR = 1.
    • Code Complexity (CC): Nested if-else makes it slightly harder to read → CC = 2.
    • Maintainability (M): Readable but could be refactored → M = 2.
Final_Score = (1*0.5) + (2*0.3) + (2*0.2) = 0.5 + 0.6 + 0.4 = 1.5
Conclusion: High (Threshold: 1.5 ≤ Score < 2.0).

Step 3: Apply LogiCoT to a New Function
Here is the function under analysis:

[The Function Code]
    
Logical Evaluation:
    • Security Risk (SR): (Analyze function)
    • Code Complexity (CC): (Analyze function)
    • Maintainability (M): (Analyze function)
Final_Score = (SR*0.5) + (CC*0.3) + (M*0.2)
Conclusion: Based on logical analysis, the function falls into the [Final Priority Group].
