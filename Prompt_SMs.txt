Task: Function Ranking in Priority Groups

Context:
Software vulnerabilities are often discovered in production software, requiring development teams to modify the source code.
These vulnerabilities typically reside in code units that are lengthy and complex. 
To proactively address potential issues, it is crucial to rank code units in priority groups during early development phases. 
This allows development teams to focus on the most problematic code units for analysis and improvement.
The main Software Metrics are:
1. Complexity: indicate how complex the code unit is, e.g. cyclomatic complexity
2. Volume: characterize the size of the code unit, e.g. lines of code
3. Coupling: indicate how coupled or not the code unit is with other units, e.g. coupling between objects
4. Cohesion: characterize how cohesive or not the code unit is, e.g. lack of cohesion

Objective:
Based on the Software Metrics, Map the provided C function into one of the following priority groups based on its complexity and security risks:
1. Critical: the source code is hard to understand and likely to be faulty or vulnerable.
2. High: the source code has some complexity, but it can be understood after reading it a couple of times.
3. Medium: the source code can be understood well, but it would benefit from some refactoring.
4. Low: the source code is easy to understand.
5. Lowest: the source code does not need any maintenance change.

Input:
this C function:
        
[Function Code]
        
    
Output Requirement:
Return only the priority group the function belongs to. Do not include any additional comments or explanations in xml format or json
